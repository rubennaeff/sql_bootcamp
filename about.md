# SQL BOOTCAMP
[As listed on website](https://generalassemb.ly/education/sql-bootcamp/new-york-city/23390)


## About This Workshop

SQL provides powerful but reasonably simple tools for data analysis and handling. This bootcamp will take absolute beginners through the basics of SQL to an ability to write queries with confidence. We will use a combination of lecture and in-class exercises to ensure that students leave with a working grasp of SQL fundamentals.


## Takeaways

- Background on SQL
- Basic `SELECT-FROM-WHERE` statements
- `LIMIT` clauses
- Math operations and constant expressions in `SELECT` statements
- Booleans and complex conditions in the `WHERE` clause
- Pattern matching in the `WHERE` clause
- `NULL` values
- `JOIN` operations
- Grouping and aggregations
- `HAVING` clauses
- `ORDER BY` clauses
- Subqueries


## Prereqs & Preparation

Basic technical aptitude and orientation to computers, and curiosity to learn new tools. Willingness to learn about a text-based/principle driven analytic tool with little real GUI support, and determination to push through the natural frustration of confronting new concepts.

We will be pausing to let students run and write queries of their own, so students should bring laptops with an installed SQL implementation.

**Please install the following two tools prior to class:**

- MySQL Server, a mostly invisible program which stores information.
- A MySQL Client, a program designed to help you interact with the server.

For instructions how to install them, please watch the
[video for Mac OS X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoMnggYTrDE), follow the
[written steps for Mac OS X](./prep.md) or watch the
[video for Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtyVlGZeDWc).
Other server and client software is fine, too, and other SQL dialects work as well, e.g., SQLlite, MySQL, Postgres, and SQL Server. Access is strongly discouraged, though.
