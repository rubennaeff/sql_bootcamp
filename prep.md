# Prereqs & Preparation

## Download a MySQL server

1. Download the MySQL Community Server (free)
   - directly from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/MySQL-5.7/mysql-5.7.17-macos10.12-x86_64.dmg)
   - alternatively, go to [dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/), scroll down and select the `DMG Archive`, and on the new page, scroll down to click on `No thanks, just start my download`.
1. Unzip and run the installation program
1. You'll be prompted with a *temporary password*, which you should copy/paste to a notepad or stickie on your machine. Please note that if you lose this password, you'll need to consult the section [How to Reset the Root Password](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/resetting-permissions.html) in the MySQL reference manual. This can be a pain.
1. Start your local SQL server. Go to ï£¿|System Preferences..., select SQL Server, and in dialog window, click Start MySQL Server.
1. Open your terminal, and type
  ```bash
  $ /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql -u root -p
  Enter password:
  ```
1. Enter the temporary password you were just given.
1. A `mysql>` prompt starts, and enter your first command to remove the password altogether:
  ```bash
  mysql> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '' PASSWORD EXPIRE NEVER;
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
  ```

Your local server is all set!
